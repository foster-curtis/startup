### GitHub
    This reading and practice was really helpful with learning the basics of GitHub and how to use it. Some of the most important things I learned were:

    - Pull, **save,** commit, and push your work __often__! This is a good habit to get into. You should not work on code without doing this process several times.
    - VS Code has embedded git functions! This makes things super easy
    - Merges are found when you pull something that was already edited that you also made changes to locally. You will be alerted of the discrepency. Compare the differences, make changes, and re-commit/push the changes to fix a merge.

It's often quite a challenge to come up with a new password for each account, and when we do, we can never remember it! Some sites will generate passwords for us, but they're just a blurb of random characters and symbols that we could never remember on our own. That's why my website, *PassPhrase*, will help you develop safe, secure passwords *that you can remember!* Your account will take centuries to hack--and your password never forgotten.",
